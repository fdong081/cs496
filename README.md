The is the project designed for course CS496.

Instructions:
We analyzes people coding behavior by record their key press frequency and the screenshot of their desktop working environment.

I.Key Binding & Code Difference


II.DataBase and Server Communication


III.Picture Capture and Analysis
To run the neural network algorithm, we need a data set in .mat format. We used the trainning examples from standford machine learning course. Thet .mat format must been saved in a natice Octave/MATLAB matrix format, not csv-file. 
Just open the folder with Octave or Matlab, then type

run predict_nn.m 

on the termiinal and it should automatically load the file then train a neural network giving prediction for you.

IV.Editing Time on files
